# Andy McGuinness' Personal Website

Hello, and welcome to my personal website! This is the _zeta_ version, meaning it's the sixth version I actually made code for. (There have been plenty of versions that never made it to code/repos.)

This site was built atop [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), using Ravi Riley's [Agency Theme](https://github.com/raviriley/agency-jekyll-theme). I have done quite a bit of customization to the layout and function of the theme, but the CSS remains largely unchanged.

My goal with this site was to quickly and easily replace my existing splash page with a fully fleshed-out website -- and I believe I have done just that.

Like any good developer, I will surely replace this website with the _eta_ version shortly, but for now, it's _aliiiiiiiiive!_

Please have a look around (and please don't judge my rusty SCSS skills).

Thanks for stopping by -- have a great day!
