WoWStatistica was built of my love for two things: statistics and World of Warcraft. While I am just learning the statistics side of things in-depth, I am very familiar with the WoW side of things -- I have maintained an active subscription since 2015.

I am a casual player at best, but I adore WoW, and I thought -- what better platform to do some data analysis? So, armed with access to WoW's own API (and Raider.io's API), I pulled the top 20 Mythic Plus runs as of 07/23/2023. What I found was not surprising, but was still interesting! In lieu of saying more, I will direct you to the website at [WoWStatistica](https://wowstatistica.com).

Technical details: that site, like this site, is built atop Jekyll; while I tried Next.js for a moment, I found I liked Jekyll better, and went back to it. I also integrated d3.js, which powers all the charts on the site; there are code blocks beneath each chart showing exactly what I did to generate that chart (with a few administrative details left out).

This was a fun project, and I look forward to continuing to deepen my data analysis skills as I go!
