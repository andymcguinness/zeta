Like any good developer, I've built and rebuilt this website a dozen times, at least. This is the zeta version of my website to make it live, and it replaces the splash screen that was previously here.

I'm really in a simple-is-best mood these days, so this site is built on a static site generator, namely Jekyll. **Why Jekyll?** Well, to be honest, I was originally going to use Gatsby.js and Tailwind CSS, but I ran into some massive headaches trying to get it installed locally. After some hours of troubleshooting, I gave up and switched to Jekyll, which I've used before and liked.

Jekyll is primarily a blogging engine; and while I didn't originally plan to use it for a blog, I ended up finding that I liked the blog aspect, and I added it back in.

The theming is based on Ravi Riley's tremendous [Agency Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/raviriley/agency-jekyll-theme/tree/master), though I've done quite a bit of customization.

Overall, this was a fun weekend project. I look forward to rebuilding my website again on a completely different stack! ;)
