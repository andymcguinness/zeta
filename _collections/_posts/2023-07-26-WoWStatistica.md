WoWStatistica is a merging of two things I love: World of Warcraft and statistics. This was a fun project that involved building a site on Jekyll, integrating d3.js, learning how to parse through JSON data with d3, and then displaying various descriptive charts and graphs.

While it was a meditation on frustration at times, I found that digging deeper and deeper into the problem allowed me to find better and better answers to my questions, which led to the successful creation of my first data analysis on the site!

I had a lot of fun, and I hope you'll watch that space for more interesting things to come!
