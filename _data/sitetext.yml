    body: "My story began in Manhattan, where I was born. I have been a lover of cities ever since! My life has taken me to New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida, Chicago, Ohio, Florida again, and now New York. Chicago and New York are up there as my two favorite places to live -- I'm just a city kid, I guess! I have worked as a barista, a sales supervisor, a JavaScript developer, a WordPress/PHP developer, a SQL analyst, and more! My varied career has taught me several things: 1. I thrive in chaos. There's nothing like being on bar at Starbucks on Black Friday. 2. I _love_ learning new things. Hence my second bachelor's! 3. Coding will always be a part of my life, no matter what!"
